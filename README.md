## Model
The model of the White House is designed in Blender. The most famous part of the White House - the Residence - was modeled. The original model also featured a garden around the White House, which was omitted in the application itself to simplify the model. 

## Application
Augmented reality application is developed using Unity3D. The application displays 3D content based on Image recognition. The Unity plugin Vuforia was used, as it supports most devices. Scripts for manipulating objects on the scene are written in C#.

Points of interest (POI) are designed in accordance with its content. For video POI is vintage TV, for audio it is a tuba and for interesting facts, it is a magnifier.
